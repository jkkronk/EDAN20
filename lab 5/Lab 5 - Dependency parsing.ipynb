    "## Objectives\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are to:\n",
    "* Know what a dependency graph is\n",
    "* Understand the principles of Nivre's parsing mechanisms\n",
    "* Extend Nivre's parser with a guiding predicate that parses an annotated dependency graph\n",
    "* Extract features to learn parsing actions from an annotated corpus\n",
    "* Write a short report on your results\n",
    "* In this assignment, you will only generate the machine-learning models from the extracted features. You will complete the parser and apply it in the next assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is inspired by the shared task of the Tenth conference on computational natural language learning,CONLL-X, and uses a subset of their data. The conference site contains a description of multilingual dependency parsing, reference papers, training and test sets for a variety of languages, as well as evaluation programs. See also CONLL 2007, on the same topic.\n",

    "Please note that the original CoNLL-X site is down. To access the pages, use the Archive.org site: https://web.archive.org/web/20161105025307/http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/ and to download the data sets, use the local copies.\n",
